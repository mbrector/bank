# Final Project Full Stack MERN App

This is my [banking app](https://mrbank.herokuapp.com/) for a bank manager. It is my Final Project for my Per Scholas Software Engineering Internship.

I wanted to do something that would keep me interested and entertained while building it. I love numbers and manipulating them so I thought a banking app would be a good choice. You can view a list of your clients, from there add accounts, make transfers, withdrawals/deposits, edit and remove clients. I enjoyed building this and connecting all the accounts. The way I set my schemas, I had to have a ternary to display only the selected client's accounts.

In the future I would like to add a client side with a login. I would also like to add a bill pay and some sort of credit application.

My backend can be found on [github](https://github.com/mbrector/bank_api) and deployed to Heroku for my [clients](https://mrbank-api.herokuapp.com/clients) and my [accounts](https://mrbank-api.herokuapp.com/accounts).
